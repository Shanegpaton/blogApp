# Simple Blog App (Follow-Along Project)

This is a full-stack project I built by following a tutorial to strengthen my understanding of Express, authentication (JWT), middleware, routing, and SQLite. The app includes features like user registration/login, post creation, editing, and secure access control.

Although itâ€™s based on a guide, I added personal notes and debugging improvements along the way. It was a major stepping stone toward building a custom essay submission site I'm currently working on.

## What I Learned
- How JWT authentication works in a Node/Express app
- Using bcrypt for password hashing
- Setting up and querying a database (SQLite)
- Middleware, routing, and rendering with EJS
